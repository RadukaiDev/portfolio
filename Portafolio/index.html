                        I teach courses for students in Computer Systems Engineering and Pedagogy programs. 
                        My work focuses on promoting logical thinking, problem-solving, and hands-on learning in key areas such as 
                        Introduction to Computing, Robotics, Calculus, and Data & File Organization. 
                        I encourage the use of active learning methods and innovative technologies to help students 
                        develop technical and analytical skills applicable to real-world environments.

                    <p class="experience__desc">
                        I designed and developed a beta-stage web application that serves as a virtual calendar, allowing users to schedule and manage events on specific dates. 
                        The project was built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, with a focus on providing an intuitive and functional interface to enhance users’ personal organization.

                    <p class="experience__desc">
                        I developed a virtual scheduling system for managing and tracking appointments, dividing the project into two independent applications: 
                        a RESTful API backend built with Spring Boot, and a frontend developed in Angular using TypeScript. 
                        The system enables efficient management of users and appointments, following best practices in architecture and service communication.

                        During my internship at the Institute of Security and Social Services for State Workers (ISSSTE), 
                        I developed a virtual scheduling system for medical appointments specifically for tuberculosis patients, improving efficiency in patient care management. 
                        I provided technical support to staff in the Teaching, Human Resources, and Nursing departments, 
                        and assisted in the installation of a fingerprint-based attendance system to enhance employee access control within the hospital.
